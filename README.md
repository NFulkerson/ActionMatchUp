# ActionMatchUp  - We are creating an MVP of Action MatchUp, basically a webpage template that will enable progressive orgs and nonprofits to accelerate their recruitment of supporters by effortlessly pooling their outreach with other groups.

The MVP will be used to do a test with 10 to 20 nonprofits in one community. At scale, Action MatchUp can greatly increase the level of civic engagement as individuals discover more relevant ways to help create a better world. Because the platform leverages the orgs' existing content, it offers a huge impact for a limited amount of development.

See http://www.ActionMatchUp.org for a 3-min video demo and more about the platform - especially 1:00 to 2:00

Objective: A page template that displays the contents of an external site with a URL provided by the presenter, adding an overlay UI that appears when exit intent is detected

The initial features required for the MVP are: 1. Embed pages from other sites (similar to StumbleUpon but no bar at the top), 2. Use exit intent popup to display links on the pages. 3. Enable admin to add urls, thumbnails and headlines. It'd be great to work with someone who shared the goal of empowering progressive orgs and nonprofits and raising the level of individual involvement.

Here is a spreadsheet of the spec broken down into testable, chewable bites via the user stories structure - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1raKXzHbgsoCiIu32FPkaG4tz2SxS1MdbGcBTvmx4JJg/edit?usp=sharing

Here's a gif showing how the new UI will appear when the user starts to exit the webpage - https://progcode.slack.com/files/U7T399K4L/F828M8YLS/ui.gif
